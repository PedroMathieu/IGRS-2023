### Sprint Report #1
## Sprint Overview:
# Sprint Number: 1

# Dates: [07/11/2023] to [27/11/2023]
# Focus Areas: Design and GRL Implementation for the SIP Service

# Accomplishments: 

# Design Phase:
Key Design Decisions and Components for GoFind 2.0:

User Base:
Define the target users as groups of friends seeking simple communication
Users believe that these contacts will strengthen their relationships

Privacy and Access Control:
Ensure the service is accessible only to a closed set of friends
Implement robust privacy measures to safeguard user data

Communication Modes:
Facilitate two forms of contact:
Direct calls between pairs of users
Participation in group conferences involving all users

Direct Call Implementation:
Enable direct calls through the standard call establishment process
Include status indications (e.g., busy) and specify if the caller has access to the service

Indirect Call Mechanism:
Allow users to initiate calls indirectly by sending a written message indicating the desired pair to contact

Responses should indicate:
The possibility of using the service
Status of the selected pair

Group Conference Sessions:
Users within the group join a conference by establishing a session to a fixed, pre-defined address.
Define mechanisms for managing participation, including adding/removing users.

User Registration Process:
Users register by providing information about:
Availability.
Identity.
###
Created: - Users GRL Diagram
         - Operator GRL DIagram

# GRL Implementation Phase:
Using GRL, we defined goals and tasks to create a diagram that responded to the project's objective

Challenges:
We encountered a challenge in interpreting both user and operator requirements while utilizing GRL
We also found difficult in relating the requirements of both sides

Next Steps:
Create the definitions of ready and implement the functions in java accordingly

Feedback and Reflection:
In reflection, our team successfully executed nearly every task in accordance with the planned timeline. 
This achievement underscores our commitment to project management and the effective coordination of our efforts.


### Sprint Report #2
## Sprint Overview:
# Sprint Number: 2
Dates: [28/11/2023] to [17/12/2023]
Focus Areas: Testing and Coding for the SIP Service using Siplets

Accomplishments: 

Coding Phase:
Made: -doRegistration() 
      -doDeregistration()
      -doAck()
      -doBye()
      -doMessage() 
      -doResponse() Non-functional
      -getPortExpires()
      -setStatus()
      -getStatus()
      -isValidAor()

Reconfigured: -doRegister()
              -getSIPuri()
              -doInvite()
              -getSIPuriPort()

Testing Phase:
Our coding process was able to smoothly incorporate extensive testing, guaranteeing a comprehensive assessment of each component. 
We carefully noted and swiftly resolved every problem that arose during testing during this phase.

Challenges:
During the development process, significant obstacles apeared mainly in the execution of vital features like registration, direct calls, conference calls, and indirect calls. 
One major issue that came up was with the direct call functionality, more specifically, the 'doBye' function. 
Here we had a problem where the route that was recorded was incorrectly set to 'false,' preventing the route from being indicated for the next ACK. 
Important details regarding the route that was recorded were not able to reach the server because of this disparity.

In order to get past this barrier, our group carefully examined the code to identify the core cause of the 'doBye' function. 
We found and fixed the problem via a code review session, making sure that the recorded route data went to the server.

Feedback and Reflection:
After all was said and done, our team completed almost all of the tasks within the allocated time.
This achievement demonstrates our dedication to project management and our ability to efficiently coordinate our accomplishments.
