# IGRS-2023

The objective of this work is the design, creation and implementation of a supplementary service
telecommunications. This service had components in the context of an out-of-context call
of a call.

## What it's purpose

As part of the Telecommunications and Computer Engineering course, this GoFind 2.0 project was initiated as an evaluation requirement for a Intelligence and Management of Networks and Computers class.

The members of the repository set out to provide an engaging and practical solution for students to take part in direct one-on-one calls, messaging or even participating in conference calls with other users by using our SIP server, all while utilising the Scrum process.

## What it does

The proposed service, “GoFind”, is a service that allows users belonging to a specific
group “meet” on a call or in a conference.

The aim is to provide an easy-to-use communication platform for friend groups looking for safe and easy ways to communicate, with the goal of strengthening their bonds over time. The main priority is privacy, making sure that only a select group of friends can use the service.

### Features:
Group Interaction: The service is intended for friends who want to quickly connect with one another. Users are sure that using this service would help them build stronger ties with other people.

Assurance of Privacy: Protecting users' privacy is of utmost importance. The program is designed to operate in a closed group, so only the designated people can communicate with each other.

### Modes of Communication:
Pair-wise Calls: Users have the option to have one-on-one conversations with a friend. There are two methods to start a call: directly and indirectly.

Group Conferences: Users can choose to take part in conferences that include the entire group.

### Direct Calls Pair-wise:
Calls can be placed by users using the regular call setup procedure.

In addition to standard call status indicators (such as busy), the caller will receive extra information indicating whether or not they have access to the service.

### Indirect Calls Pair-wise:
By delivering a textual message identifying the pair they want to speak with, users can indirectly initiate calls.

The call will then be generated automatically by the provider, expediting the communication process.
